git rules:
open command using "open git bash"
each version is saved using a hash, which you can follow
commands:
 - git clone "url" = download repository
 - git add = add a file to the stuff you want it to follow can also add star to add everything
 - ls = list all files in the git
 - touch file.type = create new file
 - git commit -m = save to repository. after m add comment what the change was
 - git status = lets you know if theres stuff to take from the web or if you added something and didnt commit
 - git push = push the changes to github
 - git pull = if someone else made a change, add it
	if there is a conflict in changes it tells us, marks it. first part is ours, second is theirs
	we delete what we dont want and save
 - git log = shows a history of all of the commits made (including message and hash)
 - git reset --hard hash/origin/master = reset back to that repository (you can still go back to the new one as long as its been saved)
